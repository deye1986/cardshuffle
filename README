No requirements, randint from random is the only import.

This is a digital deck of 52 cards including methods for shuffling, a procedure to randomize a deck 
so an element of chance is added. I used an algorithm called Fisher Yates 
shuffle to shuffle the cards to avoid ordered sequences.

I will likely build on this to develop more dynamic card games.

--  added domino pool
--  changed one side of the domioes to return a elemental style dynamic
--  added code to output card values (ace jack queen king)
--  code enhancements
